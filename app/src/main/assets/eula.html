    the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in this Agreement. Overdue
    payments will be subject to interest at the rate of 1.5% per month, or the maximum allowable under

<h3>8. OWNERSHIP</h3>

<p>8.1 Users. As between User and Trigger, the User shall retain all right, title and interest in and

    perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation. The foregoing warranty shall not apply
    to performance issues of Trigger Forge (i) caused by factors outside of Trigger's reasonable
    control; (ii) that result from any actions or inactions of User or any third parties; or (iii) that
    result from User's data structure, operating environment or equipment.</p>

<p>9.2 Sole Remedy. Should the Software not perform or function as expressly warranted herein, Trigger
    shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to correct the nonconformities giving rise to such
    breach. The foregoing remedy is available only if User notifies Trigger in writing of such
    non-conformity within fifteen (15) days of its discovery by User, and Trigger's examination of the
    Software discloses that such non-conformity exists. The foregoing remedies shall be User's sole and
    exclusive remedies and Trigger's entire liability for any breach of the warranty set forth in
    Section 9.1.</p>

<p>9.3 Disclaimer of Any Other Warranties. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS, LIMITED WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THIS
    SECTION 9, TRIGGER CORP MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO
    THE LICENSED MATERIALS, TRIGGER CORP FORGE, OR ANY OTHER ACCOMPANYING MATERIAL PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
    TRIGGER CORP SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT
    LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    NONINFRINGEMENT, THOSE ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OR TRADE, AND OF UNINTERRUPTED OR
    ERROR-FREE SERVICE, AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    LAW. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN AS IS, AS AVAILABLE
    BASIS.</p>

<h3>10 TERM; TERMINATION</h3>

<p>10.1 Term. Unless earlier terminated as provided in this Section 10, this Agreement will have an
    initial term of one (1) month (the "Initial Term"), which shall commence as of the acceptance date
    of this Agreement, and shall thereafter automatically renew for additional periods of one (1) month
    (any such "Renewal Term," together with the Initial Term, the "Term") unless either party provides
    written notice of its intention not to renew to the other party which will be effective upon receipt
    by such Party.</p>

<p>10.2 Termination.</p>

<p>A. By Either Party. This Agreement may be terminated immediately by either Party for convenience
    upon receipt of written notice to the other Party.</p>

<p>B. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, each Party shall promptly return, or
    at the other Party's request destroy, all Confidential Information of the other Party (including
    without limitation the User Data and the Documentation) except that User may retain the Trigger
    Platform-Specific Tools integrated with the User Data, where the combination have already been
    installed by Users' end-users . Sections 1, 5.2, 8, 9.3, 10.2(b), and 11-14 shall survive
    termination of this Agreement for any reason. All other rights and obligations of the Parties
    under this Agreement shall expire upon termination of this Agreement, except that all payment
    obligations accrued hereunder prior to termination or expiration shall survive such termination.</p>

<h3>11. CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>

<p>11.1 Nondisclosure. Each Party (each a "Receiving Party") agrees that it shall use and reproduce the
    Confidential Information of the other Party (the "Disclosing Party") only for purposes of exercising
    its rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement and only to the extent necessary for
    such purposes; shall restrict disclosure of such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party's
    employees, consultants, or advisors who have a need to know; and shall not disclose such
    Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written approval of the Disclosing
    Party. The foregoing obligations shall be satisfied by the Receiving Party through the exercise of
    at least the same degree of care used to restrict disclosure and use of its own information of like
    importance, but not less than reasonable care. All third parties to whom the Receiving Party
    discloses Confidential Information must be bound in writing by obligations of confidentiality and
    non-use at least as protective of such information as this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    it shall not be a breach of this Agreement for the Receiving Party to disclose Confidential
    Information if compelled to do so under law, in a judicial or other governmental investigation or
    proceeding, provided that, to the extent permitted by law, the Receiving Party has given the
    Disclosing Party prior notice and reasonable assistance to permit the Disclosing Party a reasonable
    opportunity to object to and/or limit the judicial or governmental requirement to disclosure.</p>

<p>11.2 Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Party shall be liable for
    using or disclosing information that such Party can prove: (i) was in the public domain at the time
    it was disclosed or has entered the public domain through no fault of the Receiving Party; (ii) was
    known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by
    files in existence at the time of disclosure; (iii) is disclosed with the prior written approval of
    the Disclosing Party; (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of the
    Confidential Information, as demonstrated by files created at the time of such independent
    development; (v) becomes known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, from a source other than
    the Disclosing Party without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party and otherwise not in
    violation of the Disclosing Party's rights; or (vi) is disclosed generally to third parties by the
    Disclosing Party without restrictions similar to those contained in this Agreement.</p>

<p>11.3 Remedies. The Receiving Party agrees that a breach of this Section 11 may result in immediate
    and irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party that money damages alone may be inadequate to
    compensate. Therefore, in the event of such a breach, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek
    equitable relief, including but not limited to a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction
    or permanent injunction without the posting of a bond or other security.</p>

<h3>12. LIMITATION ON DAMAGES</h3>

<p>12.1 EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR BREACH OF SECTION 5 OR SECTION 11
    AND INDEMNIFICATION FOR THIRD-PARTY DAMAGES ARISING UNDER SECTION 13 OF THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
    PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR
    EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY SOUNDS IN
    CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE.</p>

<p>12.2 MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR BREACH OF SECTION 5 OR SECTION 11 AND INDEMNIFICATION
    LIABILITY ARISING UNDER SECTION 13 OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY FOR ANY
    CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS
    MADE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE ONE-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. USER
    ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE HEREUNDER ARE BASED IN PART ON THESE LIMITATIONS. THE PARTIES
    AGREE THAT THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
    LIMITED REMEDY.</p>

<h3>13. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>

<p>13.1 Indemnification. Each Party shall indemnify, defend and hold the other Party and its officers,
    directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns harmless from and against all third-party
    claims, suits, actions, damages, settlements, losses, liabilities, costs (including without
    limitation reasonable attorney's fees) and expenses arising from a claim that Trigger Forge (as to
    Trigger), or the User Data (as to User) violates any applicable statute, regulation, or law, or
    infringes any intellectual property right or other legal right of any third party (a "Claim"). This
    indemnity does not apply to, and Trigger will have no obligation to the User for, any infringement
    or misappropriation claim that arises from (i) modifications to Trigger Forge by anyone other than
    Trigger, (ii) modifications to the Trigger Forge based upon specifications furnished by the User,
    (iii) User's use of the Trigger Forge other than as specified in this Agreement or in the applicable
    documentation, (iv) use of the Trigger Forge in conjunction with third-party software, hardware or
    data other than that approved by Trigger, or (v) any combination of the foregoing. User shall
    indemnify, defend and hold Trigger and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and
    assigns harmless from and against all third-party claims, suits, actions, damages, settlements,
    losses, liabilities, costs (including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees) and expenses to
    the extent they arise from any Claim based on any of the factors in the foregoing sentence, and
    shall give Trigger all reasonable information and assistance regarding such claim.</p>

<p>13.2 The indemnified Party shall promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any Claim;
    provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its
    indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent of any material prejudice directly
    resulting from such failure. The indemnifying Party shall bear full responsibility for, and shall
    have the right to solely control, the defense (including any settlements) of any Claim; provided,
    however, that (i) the indemnifying Party shall keep the indemnified Party informed of, and consult
    with the indemnified Party in connection with the progress of such litigation or settlement and (ii)
    the indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Claim in a manner that does not unconditionally
    release the indemnified Party without the indemnified Party's written consent, not to be
    unreasonably withheld or delayed.</p>

<p>13.3 In the event any portion of Trigger Forge is held or believed by Trigger, or any portion of the
    User Data is held or believed by the User, to infringe or misappropriate Intellectual Property
    Rights of any third party (such portion to be deemed the "Infringing Materials") in any place where
    Trigger Forge is used or accessed, then in addition to any other rights in this Section 13, Trigger
    (where the Infringing Materials are Trigger Forge) or User (where the Infringing Materials are the
    User Data) shall, at its sole expense and at its option: (i) obtain from such third party the right
    for the other party to continue to use the Infringing Materials; or (ii) modify the Infringing
    Materials to avoid and eliminate such infringement or misappropriation, as the case may be; or (iii)
    upon mutual agreement with the other party, remove and disable the Infringing Materials; or (iv) if
    none of the foregoing remedies is commercially feasible, terminate this Agreement.</p>

<p>13.4 THIS SECTION 13 SETS FORTH EACH PARTY'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION, AND EACH PARTY'S SOLE
    REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>

<h3>14. MISCELLANEOUS</h3>

    States export control laws. None of the Licensed Materials or any underlying information or
    technology may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported: (a) into, or to a national or
